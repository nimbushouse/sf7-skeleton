# Svelte + Framework7 Skeleton

This app is a skeleton to build Svelte apps with Framework7.

Framework7 does not play nice with SvelteKit for now, so this skeleton is based on Vite init template plus the Framework7 Kitchen Sink example.

### Vite

You can run vite automatically by installing the Vite VSCode extension.

The .vscode folder defines Chrome's path and disable Vite autostart cause we don't wat Vite to be started automatically when we're working on the backend.

To start developing, just hit the Vite button on VSCode footer (the blue bar) and click "Open in embedded browser".

Remember to stop Vite before closing VSCode so you don't end up with Vite running in the background.
